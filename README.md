# Arduino Leds Controller
Software implementing led strip control.</br>
## Description
It is not an art to go to the store and buy working led strips with pre-programmed patterns. The trick is to make them yourself!</br>
That's why I decided to realize it with an Arduino microcontroller and an HC-05 bluetooth.
The whole project is based on simple bluetooth communication between the microcontroller and the mobile app (HERE REFERENCE TO THE APP).
It has several led patterns and you can easily add your own patterns.

#### Patterns
- Here add all patterns descriptions
